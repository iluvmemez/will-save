# Will Save

Stop losing hours on time-sucking websites before you doing your basic language review.
Will Save is a browser extension (Chrome, Safair, Firefox) which lets you reclaim your
time. Do reviews on Duolingo to earn potions which grant you precious time on sites
you've restricted.

Will Save is Alpha, working towards a release.
