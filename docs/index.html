<h1>Hold Up There Traveler!</h1>

<p>As you might have noticed, <strong>time seems to pass by quicker on time-wasting sites</strong> like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Imgur... you know the sorts.</p>

<p><strong>Hours pass by like minutes..</strong> And sometimes you don't even remember how you got there!</p>

<h2>Here, Take This</h2>

<div class="item">
    <span class="itemcount" id="gemcount">x1</span>
    <img class="media-object" src="./assets/img/potion_full.png" width="32px" alt="potion-icon"/>
    <h5><span class="item-name">Potion of Will</span></h5>
</div>

<p>Drink this potion before entering one of these sites, and you'll stay safe.</p>

<p>Need another potion? Hop over to Duolingo to do a review. You'll brew one potion per 10 EXP on Duolingo.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Do I need to give you my duolingo password?</h2>
<p>Not at all. You simply tell the extension what your duolingo username is, and it will pull your
    exp info from the public API.
</p>

<h2>How can I tweak how many minutes I get per potion, or how many exp per potion?</h2>
<p>In the extension settings (Chrome: chrome://extensions > Will-Save > Settings, Firefox: Tools > Addons)
    you can customize these two settings. By default you get 1 potion per 10XP and 10 minutes per potion.
</p>

<h2>Will I be credited for lessons I do on the Duolingo apps?</h2>
<p>Yes! Because the extension looks at Duolingo's API, anytime you're credited with EXP you will
    be able to use it.
</p>

<h2>Does it cost money?</h2>
<p>Nope. No ads either. The amount of time it's saved me is well worth my effort.</p>
